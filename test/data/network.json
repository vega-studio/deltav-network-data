Made in the image of this God, we are created to delight in harmonious relationship, to love God, to love each other. Thus Jesus taught that the first and greatest commandment in the law is to love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind, and the second is to love your neighbor as yourself ([[Matthew 22]]:36-39). That is what we are created for. \nWhat, then, went wrong? It was not that Adam and Eve stopped loving. They were created as lovers in the image of God, and they could not undo that. Instead, their love turned. When the apostle Paul writes of sinners, he describes them as “lovers of themselves, lovers of money, . . . lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God” ([[2 Timothy 3]]:2-4). Lovers we remain, but twisted, our love misdirected and perverted. Created to love God, we turn to love ourselves and anything but God. And this is just what we see in the original sin of Adam and Eve. Eve takes and eats the forbidden fruit because a love for herself—and gaining wisdom for herself—has overcome any love she might have had for God. \n“When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it” ([[Genesis 3]]:6). The problem is deeper than her actions, deeper than outward disobedience. Her act of sin was merely the manifestation of the turn in her heart: she now desired the fruit more than she desired God. And this, says James, is just how it is with all sin: it flows from our desires, from what we wrongly love: “Each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.

There is the idea of the Tribulation, which is almost always accompanied by a belief that the saints will be \"raptured.\" I plan to research this more and record my findings here, but based on everything I've learned and all of my [[Bible Study]], I don't see much support for the concept. According to my current understanding, much of what is used to support the [[Rapture]] is either in reference to the events of A.D. 70 (e.g. [[Matthew 24]]) or somehow tied to [[2 Thessalonians 2]], which talks about the \"Man of Lawlessness\" but makes no mention of the saints being somehow swept away or spared from whatever is occurring on the earth.","create-email":"jacobmorse@gmail.com","create-time":1585864480248,"uid":"E_EdKRUgt","edit-time":1585866451062,"edit-email":"jacobmorse@gmail.com"},{"string":"Lastly, the whole idea of a literal 1000-year reign doesn't make much sense to me in greater [[New Testament]] context, or specifically in [[Revelation]], where everything is so highly symbolic.

It will no doubt be something that will go down in history—something my kids will always remember—“The COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020.” The year when, for months, we were all confined to our homes, schools and churches and offices were closed and everyone slowed down. We took more walks, we played more games, we ate more meals together. In many ways, this experience is a shocking recalibration of what we consider important. It’s a glaring opportunity to question the value of our former “normal” busyness and packed schedules. What are we really missing by calling everything off?

Sure, it’s unusual and inconvenient to be socially isolated. That part is unfortunate, as we need community and relationships. On the other hand, what seems to be stressing folks out is “not having the kids in school” or “being stuck at home with the family too much.” It was too long ago that families would have considered this arrangement “normal.” Homeschooling was more common, homesteading and farming were the way of life. The pace was slower, time spent with family was more abundant and I would assume that life was significantly more meaningful and fulfilling than it is for many people now. The reaction to the sudden requirement to “homeschool” is telling—it’s not really even homeschooling. Curriculum is still being prepared by professional teachers, videos recorded, video chats conducted. Moms and dads are essentially just casual supervisors facilitating the process and ensuring their children finish the work. And yet, to hear it described on social media, it’s such a burden!\n\nI am so thankful for Covenant and the classical (and faith-based) education it affords our children. Yet, I look to the past with envy, a time with children were predominantly homeschooled or tutored and yet learned better, read better, were better skilled in the arts and music, and developed an intimate relationship with their parents’ work, household chores and the outdoors.

If you are trying to get yourself to “plan for a project” or “write a book” then it’s hard to identify the next actionable items.

In __Freakonomics__, one of the most popular economics books of recent years, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner argued that abortion has measureable eugenic effects through reduction in crime rates. Of course that debate has an inescapable racial aspect: “Fertility declines for black women are three times greater than for whites (12 percent compared with 4 percent). Given that homicide rates of black youths are roughly nine times higher than those of white youths, racial differences in the fertility effects of abortion are likely to translate into greater homicide reductions,” Levitt and a different co-author had written in a paper that the book drew from. Whatever the merits of this argument, it is very much in line with the classical progressive case for birth control, which was developed as a national breed-improvement project rather than one of individual women’s choices. Linda Gordon notes: “A content analysis of the __Birth Control Review__ showed that by the late 1920s only 4.9 percent of its articles in that decade had any concern with women’s self-determination.”","uid":"9Xv-2mg3N","edit-time":1587520008692,"edit-email":"jacobmorse@gmail.com"},{"string":"The American Birth Control League was founded by Margaret Sanger in 1921, working out of office space provided by the American Eugenics Society. Sanger would depart seven years later as part of a factional dispute, with various elements of her organization eventually reunited in 1939 as the Birth Control Federation of America. But the words “birth control” at that time were considered public-relations poison, and so in 1942 the organization was renamed the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.","uid":"Hf1phRUj-","edit-time":1587520008692,"edit-email":"jacobmorse@gmail.com"},{"string":"Sanger herself often wrote critically about abortion, which, especially early in her career, she classified alongside infanticide, offering contraception as the obvious rational alternative to such savagery. Her arguments will sound at least partly familiar to modern ears: “Do we want the millions of abortions performed annually to be multiplied? Do we want the precious, tender qualities of womanhood, so much needed for our racial development, to perish in these sordid, abnormal experiences?” But that line of thinking was not destined to endure, and by the 1950s Planned Parenthood was working for the liberalization of abortion laws. Sanger’s successor, obstetrician Alan Frank Guttmacher, also served as vice president of the American Eugenics Society and was a signer of the second “Humanist Manifesto,” which called for the worldwide recognition of the right to birth control and abortion and, harkening back to the 1920s progressives, the extension of “economic assistance, including birth control techniques, to the developing portions of the globe.” The repeated identification of birth control with national economic planning rather than women’s individual autonomy is worth noting.","uid":"I-U3drzq-","edit-time":1587520008692,"edit-email":"jacobmorse@gmail.com"},{"string":"Continuing Sanger’s strategy of courting elite opinion as a more effective form of lobbying, Planned Parenthood’s medical director, Mary Calderone, convened a conference of her fellow physicians in 1955 to begin pressing for the legalization of abortion for medical purposes. By 1969, the demand for therapeutic abortions had grown to a demand for the legalization of abortion in all circumstances, which remains Planned Parenthood’s position today and, thanks in no small part to its very effective litigation efforts, is the law of the land.","uid":"u8MgFeg6I","edit-time":1587520008692,"edit-email":"jacobmorse@gmail.com"},{"string":"As in Sanger’s time, Planned Parenthood keeps an eye on the money and has a corporate gift for insinuation: It lobbied the Nixon administration successfully for an amendment to public-health laws, as a result of which the organization today pulls in more than half a billion dollars in federal-government funds alone, largely through Medicaid. In 1989, it founded an advocacy arm, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, that today encompasses a political-action committee and super PAC that ranks No. 23 out of 206 outside-spending groups followed by OpenSecrets.org, putting a little over $12 million into almost exclusively Democratic pockets during the 2016 election cycle.","uid":"d33G40mgn","edit-time":1587520008692,"edit-email":"jacobmorse@gmail.com"},{"string":"In Planned Parenthood’s hometown of New York City, a black woman is more likely to have an abortion than to give birth: 29,007 abortions to 24,108 births in 2013.","uid":"TKLGgWkMt","edit-time":1587520008692,"edit-email":"jacobmorse@gmail.com"},{"string":"Is it working? Lothrop Stoddard, author of __The Rising Tide of Color against White World Supremacy__, might be gratified to note that, in Planned Parenthood’s hometown of New York City, a black woman is more likely to have an abortion than to give birth: 29,007 abortions to 24,108 births in 2013. African Americans represent about 12 percent of the population and about 36 percent of the abortions; Catholics, disproportionately Hispanic and immigrant, represent 24 percent. In total, one in five U.S. pregnancies (excluding miscarriages) ends in abortion, and most women who have abortions already have at least one child. The overwhelming majority of them (75 percent, as Guttmacher reckons it) are poor. The public record includes no data about the “feebleminded” or otherwise “unfit,” but the racial and income figures suggest that Planned Parenthood is today very much functioning as its Progressive-era founders intended.","uid":"dVI5JNiw3","edit-time":1587520008692,"edit-email":"jacobmorse@gmail.com"},{"string":"If Planned Parenthood’s operating model remains familiar after 100 years, so does the rhetoric of the abortion movement.
