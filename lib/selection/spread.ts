/**
 * This method is the foundation of almost all operations in the library. It's
 * purpose is to take input nodes and gather neighbors and then gather their
 * neighbors and then gather their neighbors etc. This is grand for many normal
 * network data algorithms.
 *
 * This concept of spreading has MANY interesting ways to provide VERY
 * interesting feedback!
 *
 * - Spread from multiple start points
 * - Determine if you're interested when the spreading starts hitting overlapped
 *   points
 * - Spread and keep a track record on how to get back to the start point(s)
 * - Retrieve edges while spreading
 * - Retrieve edges only going to points that have not been spread to
 * - Spread up to a certain depth
 * - Spread and determine overlap between spreading between multiple points
 *
 * Spreading also can have actions associated with it. Perhaps you want to run
 * multiple spread operations and layer them over each other! Perhaps you want
 * to utilize some processing power!
 *
 * - Async or Sync spreading
 * - With multiple points: spread with multiple threads!
 * - Spread on an animation loop!
 * - Limit gather operations per frame!
 *
 * Spreading has many technical challenges as well as it needs to handle a
 * potential 100k+ nodes and millions of edges. As we spread we have to smartly
 * keep tracking information down as much as possible.
 *
 * Perhaps you have a higher understanding of your network data. You may be able
 * to aid the spread operation to spread with a goal in mind. Perhaps you're
 * searching for a node and your network is laid out in a way that you can
 * optimize which direction the spread operation should traverse. This spread
 * operator will also provide a means to help it along.
 *
 * So as can be seen: this is a POWERFUL method. It pins together most of our
 * operations and facilitates many of the algorithms posted here and it also
 * helps with User Experience by breaking up the operation into manageable
 * processing chunks to prevent our RAM from overloading AND prevent our draw
 * loop getting hung up for excessive periods of time.
